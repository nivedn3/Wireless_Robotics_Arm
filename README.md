# Wireless_Robotics_Arm
Controlling a remote mechanical arm with your hands movement seems to be cool.But implementing it is not that difficult. This is a cool electronics project done by me in my first year at IIT Madras. 
The components that you require 
1. Arduino Uno Microcontroller(for controlling servo motors the mechanical arm)
2. Arduino Lilypad Microcontroller (for attaching on glove).
3. 2 Xbees (or any other wireless communication module).
4. 5 Flux sensors(Changes resistance based on stress applied,use this on the glove for 5 fingers).
5. Mechanical arm with servo or stepper motors for movement.

Thats it you are good to go. Refer the codes for programming your microcontrollers.
